  <i> An Autobiography of A P J Abdul Kalam (1999),former President of India. </br>
     It was written by Dr. Kalam and Arun Tiwari.[1] Kalam examines his early life, effort, </br>
     hardship, fortitude, luck and chance that eventually led him to lead Indian space research,</br>
     nuclear and missile programs. Kalam started his career, after graduating from Aerospace</br>
     engineering at MIT (Chennai), India, at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and was assigned to </br>
     build a hovercraft prototype. Later he moved to ISRO and helped establish the Vikram Sarabhai</br>
     Space Centre and pioneered the first space launch-vehicle program. During the 1990s and early 2000,</br>
     Kalam moved to the DRDO to lead the Indian nuclear weapons program, with particular successes in</br>
     thermonuclear weapons development culminating in the operation Smiling Buddha and an ICBM Agni </br>
